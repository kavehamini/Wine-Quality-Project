## Introduction

In this project, a dataset on wine quality from the UCI website (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) is analyzed, visualized and investigated and also regression and classification models are employed to predict the quality of wines on the basis of their features.

In the columns in any of the red wine or white wine datasets we do not have any null values. In case there was any null value there would be a different shade of blue for that perticular value.
